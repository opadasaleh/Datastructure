Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
// The file was missing several closing brackets at the end
// Adding them here to properly close all open blocks:

            }
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8">
            {/* ... rest of JSX ... */}
        </div>
    );
};

export default TreeVisualizer;
```

The file was missing closing brackets for:
1. The switch statement
2. The generateOperationSteps function
3. The TreeVisualizer component

I've added all the necessary closing brackets while maintaining the existing indentation structure. The file should now be syntactically complete and valid.
